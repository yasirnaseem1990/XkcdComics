- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.

## Note For Team
* The API you guys have provided for displaying the Comics, that API is not working properly. Not much information on their websites as well
* Instead of list only one single object return [Xkcd](https://xkcd.com/info.0.json)
* Just like the above for searching there is no url, i tried so many time to search comics using this link [ xkcd search](https://relevantxkcd.appspot.com/) , but not working.
* I did integrated the code for searching as well. Just for demonstrating my approach towards.
* I did my best to follow good code practices, consistent coding style and formatting , good use of comments along with the best architecture.

#### Thanks for the opportunity Team.
